for now i need to try the following :
    if i have a pipe after the command i should creat a pipe close the reading side of the fd[2]
        wish is fd[0], and use dup2 to make the fd[1] of the pipe the duplicate of the standard output.
    if i have a pipe before the command i need to dup the the standard input with the reading side of the pipe and close
        the writing side of the pipe before hand.

if i manage to do so, what is left is to make this in a way where i call the non builtin function in a way
i need to see how others handeled the pipe in between command s to speed up the process .
