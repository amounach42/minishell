this is a brief brainstroming on how to creat the builtins :

    * for creating the pwd bultin all we need to do is to call the getcwd() systeme call and it will return the result that we whant.
    * this result should be freed after use.
    * for creating echo we will be making a putstr that will always add a new line at the end 


things that nedd to change when calling my own cd :
    * need to change the oldpwd variable in the env.
    * need the change the current woring directorie.

things that i need to handle when using cd :
    * ~ .
    * / .
    * relative path and absolute paths.
