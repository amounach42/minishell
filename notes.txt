int this section we will discuss how we are going to parse our command.

a commands arguments are splited by spaces, exemple :
    ls -la $test"as one" "okeyyy" /// with test=hhhh
this command will be splited as follow :
    ls/-la/hhhhas one/okeyyy
    and the final result should be a double **char, that will contain the following :
    **tab = ls /
            -la/
            hhhhas one/
            okeyyy/
            NULL/

to do so, we will need to expand the content of variables.Expendind the content of a variable will be in two cases:
    * if the variable is declared inside double quotes.
    * if the variable is declared outside the double quotes.

in the first case we need to convert varibales and double quotes content into strings, then start filling our **char pointer.


as a first step to emplement what's above we will try getting variables value from the **env.
