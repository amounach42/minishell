                        Pipe systeme call  in c :

In C, the pipe function is used to create a pipe, which is a unidirectional data channel that
can be used to send data from one process to another. The pipe function takes a single argument, which is an array of two integers.
These integers are used to store the file descriptors for the read and write ends of the pipe.

Here is an example of how to use the pipe function in C:

```
#include <unistd.h>

int main()
{
    int fd[2];
    char buffer[100];

    if (pipe(fd) < 0) {
        perror("pipe");
        return 1;
    }

    if (write(fd[1], "Hello, world!", 14) < 0) {
        perror("write");
        return 1;
    }

    if (read(fd[0], buffer, 14) < 0) {
        perror("read");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Received message: %s\n", buffer);

    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a pipe using the pipe function and stores the file descriptors in the fd array.
It then writes the string "Hello, world!" to the write end of the pipe using the write function, and reads 
the string from the read end of the pipe using the read function. Finally, it prints the message to the console.

Note that the pipe function is used to create a pipe between two processes that are related
to each other. If you want to create a pipe between a parent process and a child process, you
can use the pipe function in conjunction with the fork function.

                        What happens when we use pipe on a int array of two elements in c

The pipe function creates a unidirectional data channel that can be used to send data from
one process to another. When you pass an array of two integers as an argument to the 
pipe function, the function stores the file descriptors for the read and write ends of the pipe in the array.

The file descriptor for the read end of the pipe is stored in the first element of the array
(fd[0]), and the file descriptor for the write end of the pipe is stored in the second element
of the array (fd[1]).
Here is an example of how the pipe function might be used to create a pipe and store the file descriptors in an array of two integers:

```
int fd[2];

if (pipe(fd) < 0) {
    perror("pipe");
    return 1;
}
```

In this example, the pipe function creates a new pipe and stores the file descriptors for the
read and write ends of the pipe in the fd array. The file descriptor for the read end is stored 
in fd[0], and the file descriptor for the write end is stored in fd[1].

You can then use the file descriptors stored in the fd array to read from and write to the pipe using the read and write functions, respectively.



                        How does pipe generates it's file descriptors in c

In C, the pipe function creates a pipe by creating two new file descriptors, one for the read 
end of the pipe and one for the write end of the pipe. The file descriptor for the read end of
the pipe is used to read data from the pipe, and the file descriptor for the write end of the pipe 
is used to write data to the pipe.

The pipe function takes a single argument, which is an array of two integers. The pipe
function stores the file descriptors for the read and write ends of the pipe in the array, with
the file descriptor for the read end stored in the first element of the array (fd[0]) and the 
file descriptor for the write end stored in the second element of the array (fd[1]).

Here is an example of how the pipe function might be used to create a pipe and store the
file descriptors in an array of two integers:

```
int fd[2];

if (pipe(fd) < 0) {
    perror("pipe");
    return 1;
}
```

In this example, the pipe function creates a new pipe and stores the file descriptors for the 
read and write ends of the pipe in the fd array. The file descriptor for the read end is stored
in fd[0], and the file descriptor for the write end is stored in fd[1].

You can then use the file descriptors stored in the fd array to read from and write to the
pipe using the read and write functions, respectively.
