                How to use perror in c

In C, the perror function is used to print a description of the error associated with a
particular value of errno. The perror function takes a single argument, which is a string
that is printed before the error message.

Here is an example of how the perror function might be used in a C program:



```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>

int main()
{
    FILE *fp;

    fp = fopen("nonexistent_file.txt", "r");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```


In this example, the fopen function is called to open a file for reading. If the file does not 
exist, the fopen function returns NULL and sets the value of errno to indicate the error. 
The perror function is then called with the string "Error opening file" as an argument. This 
causes the following message to be printed to the console:


```
Error opening file: No such file or directory
```

The perror function is useful for printing error messages because it automatically includes 
the description of the error associated with the current value of errno, which can help you 
understand what went wrong in your program.
